### Cutting Stopper Placement


1. Move the toolhead to the end of the travel -1mm (1)
2. With a filament strand inside the cutter pull on the cutter lever and feel the end of the cutting point (with a small overshoot) (2). 
3. Place the stopper there and mark the position (3)

*Note: Try using the **Short action stopper** (Orange) for setups that require more space for installing a [purge shute/brush](https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger/tree/main/User_Mods/Other/Mini%20Purge%20Shute%20-%20%40LH)*
