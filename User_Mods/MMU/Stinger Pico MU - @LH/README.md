## Print

* PLA Prototype
* 2 perimeters, 95% infill - It is highly recommended to use the print settings included in the Orca file!  
* Make sure your extrusion multiplier is spot on. The tolerances are very small so print some parts and check for fitting. 
* Some slight post processing might be needed. 

The assembly uses two small **TPU** 2mm tabs for pushing force. 
Rubber or silicone patches might also work instead.
