## Print

* 3 perimeters, 95% infill - It is highly recommended to use the print settings included in the Orca files 
* Make sure your extrusion multiplier is spot on. The tolerances are very small so print some parts and check for fitting. 
* Some slight post processing might be needed.
* The Idler arms have to be printed top face down on a smooth sheet (not textured PEI) 

The assembly uses two small **TPU** 2mm tabs for pushing force. 
Rubber or silicone patches might also work instead.
