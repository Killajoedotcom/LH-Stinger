Filament: PLA, PETG ,ASA etc.

* 3 perimeters, 95% infill - It is highly recommended to use the print settings included in the Orca files 
* Make sure your extrusion multiplier is spot on. The tolerances are very small so print some parts and check for fitting. 
* Some slight post processing might be needed.
* The Idler arms have to be printed top face down on a smooth sheet (not textured PEI) 
    - You can improvise by taping a temporary piece of glass, fr4, etc over your printbed 

The assembly uses two small 2mm **TPU** tabs for pushing force. 
If you don't have access to TPU then you can substitute them with some rubber or silicone patches.
