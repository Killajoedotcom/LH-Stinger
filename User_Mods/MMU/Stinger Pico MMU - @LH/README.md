## Print

![](Assets/2.png)

Filament: PLA, PETG ,ASA etc.


* 0.4mm nozzle, 0.4mm line width, 0.2mm layer height (idler arms at 0.12mm if you can print well)
* 3 perimeters, 95% infill   
  *  It is highly recommended to use the print settings included in the Orca files, and change your speeds and acceleration (includes per object settings and painted seams)
* Make sure your extrusion multiplier is spot on. The tolerances are very small so print some parts and check for fitting. 
* Some slight post processing might be needed.
* The Idler arms have to be printed top face down on a smooth sheet (not textured PEI) 
    - You can improvise by taping a temporary piece of glass, fr4, etc. over your printbed 

The assembly uses two small 2mm **TPU** tabs for pushing force.   
If you don't have access to TPU then you can substitute them with some rubber or silicone patches.
