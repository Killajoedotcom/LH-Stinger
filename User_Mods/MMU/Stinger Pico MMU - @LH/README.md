Filament: PLA, PETG ,ASA etc.  
*The 4 lane version uses 113g of filament in total*

* 0.4mm nozzle, 0.4mm line width, 0.2mm layer height (idler arms at 0.12mm if you can print well)
* 3 perimeters, 95% infill   
  *  It is highly recommended to use the print settings included in the Orca files, and change your speeds and acceleration (includes per object settings and painted seams)
* Make sure your extrusion multiplier is spot on. The tolerances are very small so print some parts and check for fitting. 
* Some slight post processing might be needed.
* The Idler arms have to be printed top face down on a smooth sheet (not textured PEI) 
    - You can improvise by taping a temporary piece of glass, fr4, etc. over your printbed

*Four lane version quantities  
**The belt width used is non-standard ~4mm, which can be easily cut with scissors from a 6mm one

**Notes:**  
*You will also need a free stepper driver on your mainboard, or an [ERCF EASY BRD](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DB2wsgZ) or [EBB 42](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlhszCV) board (connected though USB, Max31865 not required)*  
*Any board that can be flashed with klipper should also work, such as a spare Ender 3 board.*

*[A filament hub and a toolhead filament sensor is also required](https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger/tree/main/User_Mods/MMU/Filament%20Hub%20-%20%40LH)*  
*Please ask in the community if there's an existing hub solution for your extruder of choice.*
